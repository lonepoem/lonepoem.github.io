<p>I have written most of these poems on my phone. I tend to make a few edits after the initial "outburst", usually over the course of a few days. If I find myself making too many edits or returning to a poem for a prolonged period, I get disgruntled.</p>

<p>The idea to create this kind of website -- with a randomly selected poem appearing each time the page is refreshed -- came to me in early 2020. I think I was in the kitchen. I soon found some JavaScript that would work for the purpose. Sometimes you may see the same poem appearing after a page refresh. Hopefully the incidence of this happening will reduce as the number of poems increases.</p>

<p>The numbering of the poems is random, as the poems themselves are, and as the triggers or itches that caused them.</p>

<p>This website has a total of 22 poems as of 18 October 2022.</p>
