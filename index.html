"Far out into the disappearance <br>When the cobwebs of recollection are<br>Easy to ignore, I shed myself into the<br>Rapacious absurd",
"Trapped in a silent gun<br>Under a descending crimson sky<br>Rising to meet it, a venerable self-loathing<br>Never out of options, never out of breath",
"Birds I cannot name<br>On trees I barely recognise<br>Giving me the bliss of ignorance<br>Preening birds, chirping birds<br>Silhouetted on a baby blue sky<br>And I, behind the windowpane<br>Unseen",
"Unless we this and unless we that<br>All these words must be produced<br>For their own sake<br>In truth there is no 'in truth'<br>Even the warming world will have to<br>Wait and see what becomes of it while<br>Mutely considering our<br>Contrivances, our mutations<br>Or just our demise<br>Collateral damage towards a new eon<br>Who cares when there's still a sun to<br>Spin around",
"Peripheral man<br>Circling, disconnected<br>Sending out my tentacles<br>Nothing happens right away<br>But years roll on and the sensors<br>Become sharper while an ambient dullness<br>Infects the guarded core, so I am at once<br>Fused to what was invisible to me, as I<br>Was to it -- and still am, for it is numb<br>To me, a man in the periphery<br>A prickly oblivion",
"Memories like hairballs<br>Spat out, wet<br>And I<br>Sheepishly unconcerned",
"Self conscious words<br>So unlike ants on the ground that<br>Couldn't care less to track a line,<br>Each one lost in the daze of the<br>Mid morning sun",
"Sunshine seeds in my garden<br>Staying put where they've been sowed<br>Never the slightest shoot, busy hiding from<br>The oppression above and its<br>Needle-like roots",
"Seeking refuge in the machine --<br>Perhaps sysadmin is for me, for<br>I never had the zest to create something;<br>Lines of code starting out with promise<br>Soon the burial ground of my wits<br>It compiles, perhaps, or not<br>Someone else is better at this<br>These hours granted to me frittered away<br>Later, travels, people, even something of a<br>Worldview<br>Touching 40, far off from the buzz,<br>I recreate the miserable times of<br>My studenthood, a nerd without a cause",
"Ancestors transplanted<br>Or a culture crossed irrevocably<br>Long ago, yet every living day<br>In a deep current of thought<br>A disturbance rages unknown",
"My heart an ancient tree<br>A splintered bark against<br>The blinding sun",
"The past it turns into stone"
